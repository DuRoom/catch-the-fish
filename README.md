# Catch The Fish

This extension is a fun experiment that adds a minigame to DuRoom.

Once enabled, admins or mods can create fish catching rounds.
The fishes will appear on the forum and users compete to catch as many as they can.

It includes many customization options.
You can let users change the fish names or choose the placement of the fish themselves.

All aspects of the game are controlled via DuRoom permissions.

The extension comes with a starting pack of (public domain image) fish that you can include when creating a new round.

## Installation
